CPE 453, Spring 18

To the best of our ability, we have tested our system and we feel that it is the best possible implementation we could complete in the time we had to work on it. 

We chose to include additional functionalities B, D, and E. We demonstrated them in our driver in the section labeled "*****Testing part 3 functions ******".

We are not aware of any current bugs, although we feel that there may be some that we were not able to find in the time being.
